# Drum Pattern Forum - WIP
I found a book called [260 drum machine patterns](https://ia800700.us.archive.org/2/items/260DrumMachinePatterns/Drum%20Machine%20-%20260%20Patterns_text.pdf) and thought it would be fun to make a simple CRUD application where people can upload their drum patterns and get creative. It's still a WIP.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash

```
